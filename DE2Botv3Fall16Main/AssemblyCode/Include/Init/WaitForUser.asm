WaitForUser:
	; This loop will wait for the user to press PB3, to ensure that
	; they have a chance to prepare for any movement in the main code.
	IN     TIMER       ; We'll blink the LEDs above PB3
	AND    Mask1
	SHIFT  5           ; Both LEDG6 and LEDG7
	STORE  Temp        ; (overkill, but looks nice)
	SHIFT  1
	OR     Temp
	OUT    XLEDS
	IN     XIO         ; XIO contains KEYs
	AND    Mask2       ; KEY3 mask (KEY0 is reset and can't be read)
	JPOS   WaitForUser ; not ready (KEYs are active-low, hence JPOS)
	LOAD   Zero
	OUT    XLEDS       ; clear LEDs once ready to continue

; End WaitForUser.asm
